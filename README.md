# Project Aurora

</p>

## This project was generated by vue-cli

## Prequisties

- install vue-cli globally
  npm install -g @vue/cli

- install vue generate component globally
  npm install -g vue-generate-component

- It is preferred to use vscode (for workspace, user settings, format sharing), but of course you can use your prefrred IDE

  P.S: You can skip global installtion by changing npm scripts to from {command} to ./node_modules/.bin/{command}
  Example: vgc mycomponent -> ./node_modules/.bin/vgc mycomponent
