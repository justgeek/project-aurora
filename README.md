# Project Aurora

<img src='aurora.jpg' style='position:relative;margin:auto; display:table' />

## This project was generated by vue-cli

## Prequisties

-   install vue-cli globally
    npm install -g @vue/cli

-   install vue generate component globally
    npm install -g vue-generate-component

-   It is preferred to use vscode (for workspace, user settings, format sharing), but of course you can use your prefrred IDE

    P.S: You can skip global installtion by changing npm scripts to from {command} to ./node_modules/.bin/{command}
    Example: vgc mycomponent -> ./node_modules/.bin/vgc mycomponent
